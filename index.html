    <section id="about">
<p id="dyk">Did you know?<li>2.01 billion tonnes of garbage waste a year.</li> </p>
<p id="abcont">The issue of landfill pollution is a persistent global challenge. Physical landfills are not only reaching their maximum capacity but are also significantly contributing to environmental degradation. The accumulation of waste from resources like excess food and office supplies, is a growing concern. As of 2021, 900 million tonnes of food waste was recorded to be discarded annually. Projections indicate that by 2050, global waste could escalate to 3.40 billion tonnes.</p>
<p id="abcont1">A third of the world’s waste originates from developed countries. However, developing countries, with 90% mismanagement of waste, contribute significantly to air and land emissions which negatively impacts our biodiversity. This waste degrades soil fertility, rendering land unfit for crop production. Unregulated waste can also facilitate the spread of infectious diseases and pose a threat to wildlife.</p>
<p id="abcont2">As of 2019, our oceans were home to 5.25 trillion pieces of waste. Non-biodegradable waste, such as plastic, is particularly harmful as it contains high levels of toxic metals like copper or lead. These hazardous materials are often found in populated areas and pose a risk of contaminating our water supply and oceans. If we continue with our current waste management strategies, we risk transforming our planet into a garbage dump, making it uninhabitable. So what do we do with all this garbage?</p>
